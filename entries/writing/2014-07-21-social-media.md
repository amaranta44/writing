# Outline

## Intro/Thesis

* Deleted all social networks pertaining to my personal life 


## Background/Problem

* Over the years of using various social networks, I've come to the conclusion that the innate value they provide weighed by the sheer amount of time devoted to building/using them is entirely out of proportion.
  * Social networks seem to devolve into a noisy, distraction machine fueled on the pursuit of stars, likes, favorites and other arbitrary metrics misconstrued for attention and interest. The end game is a amalgamation of people "sharing" everything; the vast majority of which never needed to see the light of day.

### Everyone is wasting everyone's time

* We all share things of questionable value (at best)
* Platform for self-promotion and monologue
* The links we post are rarely every read in full
* It turns out a platform for self-promotion and monologue doesn't turn out to be the best medium for discussion (imagine that)
* This results in a massive distraction and exercise in futility.
* Yes, compelling things do happen (e.g., Green Revolution), but far too infrequently. At that scale, something valuable is bound to happen. But meaningful content shouldn't be a statistical aberration.

### Social Networks are _Anitsocial_

* My greatest moments of insight have been when I struggled on a problem, alone or sitting with a person over coffee/lunch and having a long discussion.


### Garbage In, Garbage Out



### Popular Now Equates to _Good_

* Photographer personalities example
* Backwards priorities - more time spent on promoting/tracking engagement on a piece of content than it took to actually create it 

### We've falsely equated "staying informed" with "obsessively [checking]"

## My resolution

* I'll focus more on creating good work for the sake of creating good work.
* I still _would like_ for the work I create to be read/seen, but I refuse to play the social media game. 
* If I want to share information - I need to do it the "old fashioned way", by talking to people in person at events or one on one
