## Notes

* Over the years of using various social networks, I've come to the conclusion that the innate value they provide weighed by the sheer amount of time devoted to building/using them is entirely out of proportion.
  * Social networks seem to devolve into a noisy, distraction machine fueled on the pursuit of stars, likes, favorites and other arbitrary metrics misconstrued for attention and interest. The end game is a amalgamation of people "sharing" everything; the vast majority of which never needed to see the light of day.
