# The Problem With Comments

It's hard not to imagine the web without comments. They're everywhere. The comment section seems exist in certain places simply because of its legacy. Other networks and technologies have sprung up since the inception of the comment which arguably are better suited for conversation. And have you read many comments lately? It's often hard to understand how we have functioning societies after spending more than 5 minutes skimming through YouTube comments.

Tackling the subject of internet comments is far too expansive for this post. For this entry, I'm going to focus on comments around the written word and provide my critique and proposed alternative. 

## The three main problems with comments

### Comments are noisy

Comments are a jumbled, unorganized mess *before* touching the subject of blog spam. *Anyone* can say *anything*&mdash;and the problem is that they do. There's considerable evidence that many readers do not even fully read a piece of written content [cite source]. Throw in the safe assumption that *many* of the people commenting are not fully reading the article and it makes the problem even worse.

A great example of this noise comes from [NPR's April Fools joke](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/01/297690717/why-doesnt-america-read-anymore) this year. The comments of people who clearly did not read the 7 lines of content in the article are followed by the dedicated readers who end up egging on the others. Very few constructive discussions come from this system of user interation.

This noise is rarely beneficial for the writer or even the reader for that sake. Why then have it be a part of the content?  

**Notes:**

* Spam
* Undirected
* Equal weight to unequal thoughts
* Unfocused. Say-whatever format leads to a jumbled mess

### Comments are passive
Comments were a good first try for allowing readers to interact with content creators. It was a *huge* step up from its alternatives (e.g., mailing a letter to the editor). That said, comments are not *really* interactive. They're more often than not a segregated collection of content where readers are given the opportunity to "discuss amongst themselves". 

It's my theory that this segregation greatly contributes to the level of low quality of comments. There's no ownership, no way for readers' to shape/improve a piece of content. Why would a reader invest time in contributing if the author doesn't value it? This passive format does not encourage meaningful creator-consumer interaction. That doesn't mean it can't or doesn't happen. It does&mdash;*despite* the format of comments. 

**Notes:**

* Poor conversational medium
* No ownership

### Comments are unproductive (for everyone)
The two problems above lead to the next problem, that comments are simply a waste of everyone's time. It's chatter that is quickly forgotten, deleted or never seen to begin with. At best, it's wasting the commenter's time, at worst, it's wasting the author's time having to moderate, delete and cull comments. Instead of creating more/better content, they're babysitting. 

**Notes:**

* Futile
* Unfulfilling 
* Undirected feedback, positive or negative, is a waste of time


## Replace comments with genuine reader interaction

There needs to be a reciprocal relationship between reader and writer. Where readers have the opportunity to provide concrete, directed feedback to improve a writer's work. In short, a pull request for writing&mdash; which is why I'm writing on Github. This relationship raises the role and expectations of the reader. It blurs the line between reader and writer and creates a sense of ownership for contributors. Most importantly, it focuses the interaction around content on improving it.  

**Notes:**

* People are when they have ownership, "I helped make that"
* Changes the role and expectations of the reader. 


### This model creates a (positive) barrier to entry 
To be honest, not everyone *should* contribute to certain content. Few are qualified to provide meaningful/valuable feedback on an article covering tax law&mdash;including myself&mdash;which means I should either. Interaction with content should be a meritocracy rather than democracy. It's going to force people to either do their homework or forever hold their peace.


### Contributions should mean something
Opinions are like noses, everybody has one. Few have solutions. There should be a sense of accomplishment having an edit/revision included into a piece of content. There also needs to be credit/acknowledgement to those who contribute. This means writers are going to have to loosen the reigns on their content and show an openness towards public contributions. For people working on open source projects, it's second nature. For a lot of writers, this is going to be different and uncomfortable.

### Let the general conversation happen elsewhere
The behavior of "commenting" on content&mdash;including written content is increasingly migrating to social networks. This trend is real and positive. It creates a clear outlet for people not interested in contribution or direct interaction. If someone wants write an undirected gush/rant about your work, let that stay on Twitter or Facebook. Meanwhile, you can focus on making your work better.

## We need new tools

The online written word is the most accessible form of media for consumers to contribute to. There's a clear opportunity in this space, the tools just do not yet exist. Writing on Github is my attempt to prototype this concept on the closest tool I could find. But clearly, this approach is a square-peg-in-a-round-hole hack.

**Unorganized Notes**


* Comments rarely, if ever directly lead to a better final product. 
	* Critique/Feedback is invaluable and comments can provide insight into general sentiment. 
	* Concrete results are missing

* It's not a conversation
	* It's a monologue followed by a collection of disparate monologues. 
	
* "Comments" have been replaced with status updates. 
	* Better in ways, worse in others
	* Still disparate monologues
	* Meaningful conversations cannot happen in chunks of 140 characters
	

* The best way to share an idea is to let others be a part of it.
	* The best way for others to be a part of it is to let them help give it shape.
	
* Collaboration around writing can take many different forms
	* Critique  
	* Editing
	
* No more armchair quarterback
	* Have a problem with a post? Make is better.
	* Let's have conversations result in meaningful results.
	* Think you can do it better? Fork it and prove it

* CodePen Comments are a good thing
	* Pen creators have control over curating their pen comments
	* 'Be Cool' placeholder sets a standard for commenters attitude
	* Good general community
