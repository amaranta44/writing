# Writing for the long haul

http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890


* Find a small set of topics you're passionate about
* Write about them consistently
* Treat your body of work like a contiuous long-term project

The challenge is determining whether something you've written is meaningful enough to continue working on. These things often take time to gestate. Your mind needs time to process whether the thought was fleeting or if it has legs. Blogs/journals are great testbeds for this. Throw your ideas out there and let them marinate. Extract the good ideas from your "flow" and make it a part of your project(s).


* Information exchange in the online age
* Designing for fulfillment
* Iconography & Information design for the web
* Web performance

## introduction

We write for the moment. Today's publishing platforms focus on a journaling mode of writing. From status updates to blog posts - there's a publish date and an implied "freshness date" before the content is preserved purely for the sake of posterity. This is fine for content that is firmly set in the moment. It's fine to keep a scrapbook of snapshots. 

The problem is we're also using those scrapbooks to record content of greater meaning. 

Writing content which is intended to live beyond the moment requires a different process and set of tools. 

What if you only publishes ten pieces of content on the web in your entire life. What if you spent the majority of your life working on them? What would that even look like? 

I think a lot of bloggers are in many ways doing that, just in a very inefficient, ineffective manner. We are often talking about the same collection of subjects, ideas and opinions--they're just created as different and disconnected fragments. We're not connecting the dots or threading them into a single, coherent thread.

And that's why so much of our content is a short-sided, jumbled mess. We don't spend the appropriate time to revise, amend, rethink or adjust our content after the publish date. Content is written, frozen in time and ignored.

Ideas don't work that way. They continue to grow and mutate. Our content should do the same. So instead of generating a stream of new, why aren't we cultivating what we already have?
