An Experiment in Writing
=======

This entire repository is very much a work in progress and represents my process to make sense of ideas rattling in my head.

## What's in This Repo?

Simply put, my writing on a collection of subjects. The blog format seems _old_ and no longer aligned with what the web is capable of or where it's headed. This idea has slowly grown in intensity for myself since I stumbled upon the idea [in a past blog post](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/what-comes-after-sharing/). Now I'm finally going to just try to do it.

I'll be breaking up content into two main buckets. I've named them Entries and Epics (naming is _highly_ suspect).

### Entries

Entries are snapshot of ideas. They are intellectual flings, experiments and potentially fleeting thoughts. They may be a one night stand, they may be the one you bring home to your mother, it's still too early to tell. This type of content is what you normally see in a blog.

### Epics

Epics are your intellectual passions and dearest partners. They're with you when you wake up and when you go to sleep. They evolve, morph, migrate and sometimes even flip 180 degrees, but they never go away. This kind of content is where I think blogs fall short, and what I'm most interested in.

## Interested in Following This Experiment?

I'm still trying to figure out the best ways to make that happen. Until then, you can [follow this Github repo](https://github.com/somerandomdude/writing/star), subscribe to the [commit history RSS feed](https://github.com/somerandomdude/writing/commits/master.atom). I'll also be tweeting out updates from [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/somerandomdude).

## Following is Passive, Let's Do This Together

I'm excited about this idea because it creates the opportunity to allow a more meaningful way for writers and readers to engage. **I welcome and encourage you to submit pull requests to any/all content I create.** To be honest, the experiment fails without it.
